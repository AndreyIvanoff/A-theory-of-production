# A Theory of Production
One interesting pastime for a data visualization expert could be the task of restoring old charts. Indeed, in the pre-digital era, creating complex visualizations was undoubtedly considered an art form.

Take a look at this remarkable diagram presented by Cobb and Douglas in their work 'Theory of Production,' released in 1928: the intriguing scales, cleverly annotated labels, and the grid itself. While it is possible to replicate this chart using modern tools, such as the Plotly library, it remains an exceptionally challenging endeavor.

This repository contains source code that attempts to closely replicate this visualization. The Plotly library is utilized for this purpose.
